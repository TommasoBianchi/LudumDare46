# The Tribe

*The Tribe* is a card game in which you have to feed a constantly growing tribe, progressing through time and unlocking better ways of producing food for your increasingly big family of cavemen. 
Keeping them alive, year after year, is your goal!

## How to Play

* drag cards from your hand into the field to play them
* each card has a cost, listed in the top-right corner (you will pay it for playing it indipendently of where you play it)
* cards can be played into the field for their effects (listed in the bottom half of the card), or into one of the three left zones for a special effect (duplicate the card, remove it from the deck, upgrade it)
* each time you play a card, you get to draw a new one from the deck
* after each turn, all your cards go back in the deck, it gets shuffled and you get to draw a new hand
* each turn, you will need to produce enough food to sustain your population, otherwise you will lose the game
* each turn, your population will grow, demanding more food
* if you collect enough faith by worshipping the gods, they will gift you the choice of a new card
